## 🔧 Development Workflow

### Getting Started

```bash
# 1. Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/involution-engine.git
cd involution-engine

# 2. Development environment
docker-compose up -d  # Starts all services

# 3. Run tests
./scripts/run_all_tests.sh

# 4. Check code quality
ruff check . && black --check . && mypy .
```

### Code Quality Standards

- **Type Safety**: Full mypy coverage with strict mode
- **Formatting**: Black with 88-character line length
- **Linting**: Ruff with aggressive rule set
- **Security**: Bandit security scanning
- **Testing**: >90% code coverage requirement

### CI/CD Pipeline

Three-tier pipeline for optimal developer experience:

1. **Quick Check** (PR feedback): Basic tests, linting, type checking
2. **Comprehensive** (merge): Full test suite with accuracy validation
3. **Nightly** (extended): Stress testing, edge cases, security scans

**Accuracy Gates**: All planetary position calculations must maintain >99.9% agreement with Swiss Ephemeris.

**Performance Budget**: P95 latency must remain <500ms under load.
